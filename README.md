- I normally design many in-class activities for upper-level classes to motivate discussion and collaborative learning. However, given the risks of going to a classroom and other constraints you might have, I will allow people to join remotely through Zoom for the first few weeks. The zoom session will also be recorded.  We will adjust as the semester goes.

- Please fill in this [background survey](https://forms.gle/XrrcWoy2axsLsYA8A) and [topic preference as discussant](https://forms.gle/h7FhpscYqDKaQzzr5) before Sept 7th.

## Description
This course is going to explore how to design and build an intelligent system from a software engineering perspective, from requirement gathering and analysis to deployment and maintenance. We will also touch AI ethics and its implications to design.

## Prerequisite
While there are no official prerequisite courses, you will enjoy and appreciate this course more if you have taken COMP303, COMP424 and COMP551 already.

## Reference Material
We will not concentrate on any particular resources. Instead, the readings will include content from book chapters, research papers, blog posts, talks, etc. The pointers to those content will be added to the schedule later.

- **Books**: 
  * [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557) (Chapter scans will be shared through OneDrive links)
  * [Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/hc.html) (Chapter scans will be shared through OneDrive links)
  * [Design Justice](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice) (open access) 
  * [Building Intelligent Systems <em>A Guide to Machine Learning Engineering</em>](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-intelligent-systems/9781484234327/) (access through McGill Library)
